            description: 'Mapping COVID-19 disease cases and risk is challenging and depends upon the geographical unit chosen to determine who is at risk from their neighbors. <br><br>  In the following examples, we highlight how such maps are typically presented, by calculating the number of cases of COVID-19 in a certain residential area (city, county, or smaller geographic unit like a 10km hexagon, as we present on our site). However, presenting risk in this way assumes that an individual’s exposure to COVID-19 cases happens exclusively within their residential neighborhood. Through the following explainer, we illustrate why this might not be a ‘true’ representation of reality, and introduce a personal COVID-19 risk map for the state of Michigan to address some of the assumptions that come with these geographic maps.',
